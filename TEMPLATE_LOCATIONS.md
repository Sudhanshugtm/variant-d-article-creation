# Where to Find the 8 New Article Templates

The 8 new templates are accessed through the **Step-by-Step Guide** (variant-d.html) in the category selector.

## Navigation Path:

1. Click "Step-by-Step Guide" from index.html
2. Press "/" in the editor to open category selector
3. Select a category to see the new templates:

### Template Locations:

**Culture Category:**
1. **Films** → Culture > Film & Television > Films
2. **TV Series** → Culture > Film & Television > TV Series  
3. **Books/Novels** → Culture > Literature > Books & Novels
4. **Video Games** → Culture > Video Games > Video games

**Society Category:**
5. **Companies** → Society > Organizations & Companies > Companies & Businesses
6. **Sports Teams** → Society > Organizations & Companies > Sports teams

**Geography Category:**
7. **Buildings** → Geography > Landmarks & Buildings > Buildings & Architecture

**History Category:**
8. **Historical Events** → History > Historical Events > Major historical events

## The Current Index Page Shows:

- **2 creation paths** (not 8 individual templates)
- The templates are nested inside the "Step-by-Step Guide" path
- They appear when users select their article category

## Would you like me to:

Option A: Update index.html to showcase all 8 new templates as direct options?
Option B: Add a preview/showcase section on index.html showing the new templates?
Option C: Keep the current structure (templates nested in categories)?
